\usage{
read_flights(
  date = 202001,
  type = "basica",
  showProgress = TRUE,
  select = NULL,
  cache = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{Numeric. Date of the data in the format \code{yyyymm}. Defaults to
\code{202001}. To download the data for all months in a year, the user
can pass a 4-digit year input \code{yyyy}. The parameter also accepts
a vector of dates such as \code{c(202001, 202006, 202012)}.}

\item{type}{String. Whether the data set should be of the type \code{basica}
(flight stage, the default) or \code{combinada} (On flight origin and
destination - OFOD).}

\item{showProgress}{Logical. Defaults to \code{TRUE} display progress.}

\item{select}{A vector of column names or positions to keep. The rest of the
columns are not read. The order that the columns passed determines the
order of the columns in the result.}

\item{cache}{Logical. Whether the function should read cached data downloaded
previously. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{FALSE}, the function will
always download the data and overwrite cached data.}
