The flight data in the **flightsbr** package is downloaded from Brazilâ€™s Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The data includes detailed information on every international flight to and from Brazil, as well as domestic flights within the country. The data include flight-level information of airports of origin and destination, flight duration, aircraft  type, payload, and the number of passengers, and several other variables. 

A description of all variables included in the data is available at \url{https://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/setor-regulado/empresas/envio-de-informacoes/descricao-de-variaveis}.



Now we can load some libraries we'll use in this vignette:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(flightsbr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

```

Download data of all flights:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# in a given **month* of a given **year** (yyyymm)
df_201506 <- read_flights(date=201506, showProgress = FALSE)

# in a given year (yyyy)
df_2015 <- read_flights(date=2015, showProgress = FALSE)

```


If you know already what data columns you need, you can pass a vector with their names to `select` parameter and `read_flights()` will only load those columns. This will make the function a bit faster. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
df_201506 <- read_flights(date=201506, 
                          showProgress = FALSE,
                          select = c('id_empresa', 'nr_voo', 'dt_partida_real',
                                     'sg_iata_origem' , 'sg_iata_destino'))

head(df_201506)
```

The package makes it easy to compare daily number of passengers across different years.


```{r, eval=TRUE}
df_2019 <- read_flights(date=2019, showProgress = TRUE)
df_2020 <- read_flights(date=2020, showProgress = TRUE)
```
