**flightsbr** is an R package to download flight data from Brazilâ€™s Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The data includes detailed information on every international flight to and from Brazil, as well as domestic flights within the country. The data include flight-level information of airports of origin and destination, flight duration, aircraft  type, payload, and the number of passengers, and several other variables. 

A description of all variables included in the data is available at \url{https://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/setor-regulado/empresas/envio-de-informacoes/descricao-de-variaveis}.
