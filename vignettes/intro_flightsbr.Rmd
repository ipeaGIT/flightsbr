The data include flight-level information of airports of origin and destination, flight duration, aircraft  type, payload, and the number of passengers, and several other variables.

### `read_airports()`
Airports data covers all airports and aerodromes registered in Brazil’s Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC).  It covers detailed information on ICAO code, municipality, geographical coordinates, runway dimensions etc.

## Basic usage

Before using **flightsbr** please make sure that you have it installed on your computer. You can download the most stable version from CRAN.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("flightsbr")
```

Now we can load the library and start downloading data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(flightsbr)
```

#### Download flights data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# in a given **month* of a given **year** (yyyymm)
df_201506 <- read_flights(date=201506, showProgress = FALSE)

# in a given year (yyyy)
df_2015 <- read_flights(date=2015, showProgress = FALSE)

```

#### Download airports data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airports_all <- flightsbr::read_airports(type = 'all', showProgress = FALSE)

airports_prv <- flightsbr::read_airports(type = 'private', showProgress = FALSE)

airports_pbl <- flightsbr::read_airports(type = 'public', showProgress = FALSE)


```


#### Download data of aircrafts:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
aircrafts <- flightsbr::read_aircrafts(showProgress = FALSE)

head(aircrafts)
```
